# ReviewsNLP
This application analyzes the reviews from the product: “Fire HD 8 Tablet with Alexa, 8 HD Display, 16 GB, Tangerine – with Special Offers” 
from the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products. (Currently only the first 100 rows)

I developed a BoW and a TF-IDF model to make a first impression
I then developed a LSA and a LDA model.

The LDA model is currently not giving good result, so working on that.

Steps to run this application:
1. Download python 3.10+
2. Download the nltk data (stopwords)
3. Run main.py
